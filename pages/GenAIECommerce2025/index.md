        **From Search to Conversational Shopping with Generative AI**

      abstract: >
        The rapid growth of online shopping platforms such as Amazon has brought services to billions of people worldwide. With global retail sales surpassing $6 trillion in 2024 and is trending increase in 2025, customer expectations for personalized and seamless shopping experiences have never been higher. In this talk, I will share our multi years journey of reimagining online shopping at Amazon—transforming it from a product search problem into a conversational shopping experience powered by generative models. Specifically, I will cover: (1) How the product search engine traditionally worked. (2) How we began adopting conversational shopping and use language models for this new paradigm. (3) How we are building shopping agents that empower customers with richer, more personalized experiences.

# Overview
The "Gen AI for E-commerce" workshop explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence in transforming e-commerce through enhanced user experience and operational efficiency. E-commerce companies grapple with multiple challenges such as lack of quality content for products, subpar user experience, sparse datasets etc. Gen AI offers significant potential to address these complexities. Yet, deploying these technologies at scale presents challenges such as hallucination in data, excessive costs, increased latency response, and limited generalization in sparse data environments. This workshop will bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss these challenges and opportunities, aiming to showcase case studies, breakthroughs, and insights into practical implementations of Gen AI in e-commerce. 

# Call for papers
We will welcome papers that leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) in e-commerce. Detailed topics are mentioned in [CFP](https://genai-ecommerce.github.io/GenAIECommerce2025/call-for-papers).
