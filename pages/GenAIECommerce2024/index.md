        **Title of the talk: Generalizing Large Language Models for E-commerce from Large-scale, High-quality Instruction Data**

      abstract: >
        With tremendous efforts in developing effective e-commerce models, conventional e-commerce models show limited success in generalist e-commerce modeling, and suffer from unsatisfactory performance on new users and new products – a typical out-of-domain generalization challenge. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e- commerce, in this talk, I will present ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction dataset for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce LLMs, by instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline models, including the most advanced GPT-4 and the state-of-the-art task-specific models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability to out of-domain settings, including unseen products and unseen instructions, highlighting its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective LLMs for e- commerce. ECInstruct and eCeLLM models are publicly accessible through https://ninglab.github.io/eCeLLM/.

# Overview
The "Gen AI for E-commerce" workshop explores the role of Generative Artificial Intelligence in transforming e-commerce through enhanced user experience and operational efficiency. E-commerce companies grapple with multiple challenges such as lack of quality content for products, subpar user experience, sparse datasets etc. Gen AI offers significant potential to address these complexities. Yet, deploying these technologies at scale presents challenges such as hallucination in data, excessive costs, increased latency response, and limited generalization in sparse data environments. This workshop will bring together experts from academia and industry to discuss these challenges and opportunities, aiming to showcase case studies, breakthroughs, and insights into practical implementations of Gen AI in e-commerce. 
# Call for papers
We will welcome papers that leverage Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) in e-commerce. Detailed topics are mentioned in [CFP](https://genai-ecommerce.github.io/GenAIECommerce2024/call-for-papers). Papers can be submitted at [Easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=genaiecom24).
