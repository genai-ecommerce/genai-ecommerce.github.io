# GenAIEcommerce Workshop Website

This repository hosts the official website for the GenAIEcommerce Workshop series. The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

## Repository Structure

- Each year's workshop has its own dedicated webpage (e.g., `2024/`, `2025/`)
- The main `index.html` points to the current year's workshop page
- Website configurations are stored in `_config.yml`
- Paper data for each year is stored in `_data/papers.yml`

## Maintenance

To add a new year's workshop website:
1. Create a new directory for the year (e.g., `2025/`)
2. Copy and update the necessary assets and content
3. Update the main `index.html` to point to the new year's page
4. Update the paper data in `_data/papers.yml` for the new year
