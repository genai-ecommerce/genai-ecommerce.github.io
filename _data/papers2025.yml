  abstract: >
    In multi-vertical e-commerce platforms like DoorDash, relatively newer product verticals such as grocery and retail present a significant opportunity for personalization innovation. A key challenge lies in solving the "cold start" problem for users. This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing recommendation quality by transferring knowledge from data-rich verticals (e.g., restaurants at DoorDash) to data-sparse ones. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform generative inference, synthesizing sparse, high-dimensional features that encapsulate user preferences across different verticals.
